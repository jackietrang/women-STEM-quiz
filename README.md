# women-STEM-quiz

I curated a set of questions about women in engineering and made it into a quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I made this quiz during my summer at Girls Who Code where I taught students web development.

By doing a project myself, I find it easier to sympathize with students' struggles when learning a new concept.
